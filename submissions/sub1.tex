\section{Indexing}
https://github.com/castorini/Anserini


 This effort grew out of a reproducibility study of various open-source retrieval engines in 2016 (Lin et al., ECIR 2016). Additional details can be found in a short paper (Yang et al., SIGIR 2017) and a journal article (Yang et al., JDIQ 2018).

I CAN INDEX USING ANSERINI AS A CONTRIBUTION. According to the table 1 in Rodrigo's paper Anserini (based on Lucene!) outperforms Lucene.
